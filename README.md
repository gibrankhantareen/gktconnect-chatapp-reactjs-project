# GKTConnect Chat App - ReactJS Project

I am learning ReactJS. This is a Project I made using the concepts of ReactJS. I have made this project using ReactJS and Firebase. It allows users to connect via Google and chat with anyone online :)
## What Key concepts have I implemented in it?

- The concept of "usestate" in React
- If a user is Logged out he will be shown a Welcome page
- If a user is successfully signedup he will be shown Chat area
- Fetching the User's profile pic + Name from Firebase DB
- Fetching all the User messages with respect to sender
